# **Machine Learning on Saudi Arabia Used Cars**

## **Background**
The data provided contains information on used cars being sold in Saudi Arabia. This dataset includes key details such as type of car, region where the car is offered for sale, gear type of car, mileage of car, pricing, among many others. The primary focus of this project is to create an accurate machine learning model, which can be used by the business to predict prices of used cars accurately, in order to maximise the business revenue. By utilizing a diverse set of machine learning models, including regression and ensemble techniques, the project aims to see how accurate an algorithm can get, while analysing its possible impacts on the business, whether positive or negative. This project encompassed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques.

## **Business Problem**
A business on used cars in Saudi Arabia requires being able to sell used cars at a reasonable price, and there are many factors that come into play when determining the price of used cars. Can we develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the optimal listing price for used cars based on the various attributes that are given above, in order to maximise our profits?
### **Approach**
This problem can be solved in several parts: 
1. Firstly, we will need to analyse the data given above, determine the presence of extreme outliers in the data, and analyse the correlation between the features and target. 
2. Afterwards, we will create a regression model using the best possible algorithm, so that this model can be used by the business to estimate the most reasonable price of a used car.
The files attached will guide us through the process of building the algorithm, in an attempt to answer the question that we have asked above.

## **Files**
There are several files in the repository:
1. One Jupyter notebook file, **Machine Learning.ipynb**. The full step-by-step process of this project is found in this file.
2. One csv file, **data_saudi_used_cars_raw.csv**, which is the raw dataset that we'll be working with.
3. One document file, **Saudi Arabia Used Cars.docx**, which is a document that describes the context of the project, as well as all the variables available in the dataset.
4. One sav file, **Best_Model_Pickled.sav**, which is the best algorithm created from the project, used to predict the prices of the used cars.

My entire thought process and coding is found in the notebook **Machine Learning.ipynb** file.
